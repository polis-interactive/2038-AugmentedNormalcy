14. Q Is outputting with KMSSINK (a drm compositior) adding the lag?
	A Yes, pushing pixels straight to the display buffer heavily decreases percieved lag

15. Q Does the screen size appreciably change the amount of lag?
    A Ostensibly, no; lag was injected by the display manager, we got the same latencies for 480p, 720p, and 1080p. Only frame rate changed the preceived lag in these cases. It also doesn't matter for 2k, and it doesn't matter when pushing out to the fbdev while lopping off pixels


 Done-ish: 4-12

 Will be done with libcamera integration: 1-3, 13

 Will be done with wayland compositor: 14

 Phsyical parts need selecting: 1, 15

 Questions:
 	Can the image be duplicated performantly on the PI?
 	If yes: dope
 	If no: Can the image be duplicated performantly on the server?
 		   Does passing around the extra pixels negatively impact performance?

 	Can we get a screen that is natively supported by the rpi?
 		Can this screen be exactly half a native resolution of the pi cam 3?

 	What resolutions are natively supported by the pi cam 3? Can we just lop off pixels
